This is code based on simulating this following Math riddle.

"Flip 100 coins, marked 1-100. Each second, Alice and Bob simultaneously check one coin. Alice goes in order (1, 2, 3, …); Bob checks the odd coins, then the even (so 1, 3, 5, …, 99, 2, 4, 6, …). Who is more likely to see two consecutive heads OR two consecutive tails *first*?"
